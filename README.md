## Advent of Code solutions
All years that I've participated in, tested and working in Python 3.10

- code: `day**.py3` (e.g. `day03.py3` - for some days I also have other scripts for testing things)
- input: `day**_example-input.txt`
- run with: `python3 day**.py3 < day**_example-input.txt` or `cat day**_example-input.txt | python3 day**.py3`
  - (or `./day**.py3 < day**_example-input.txt` if `*.py3` is marked executable)

### Where are the full input files?
Per an [old tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081) from Eric Wastl, creator of the Advent of Code:
> In general I ask people not to publish their inputs, just to make it harder for someone to try to steal the whole site.

There are also different versions of the input files for different users, you can sign in at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) to download full input files.
